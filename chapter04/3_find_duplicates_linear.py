A Linear Solution

Algorithm: page 58
Time complexity: O(n) or linear time.
Here the hasDuplicateValue() function takes n steps and combine with the find_max()
function which also takes n steps, in total there are 2n steps.
In terms of time complexity, the constant 2 is drop and hence O(n).

This new algorithm appears to make n comparisons for n data elements. This is because 
thereâ€™s only one loop, and it simply iterates for as many numbers as there are in the array.
