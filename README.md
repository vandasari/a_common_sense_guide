# Algorithms, Examples, and Exercises from A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, 2nd Edition (2020)

A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, 2nd Edition, by Jay Wengrow published in 20202 is one of several books on data structures and algorithms that I really enjoy reading. It explains all subjects step-by-step and with so much clarity. A must read for beginners or those who don't have a background in computer science.

The book comes with a lot code examples which are mainly written in Ruby, although a few is also given in Python and JavaScript. This repository contains my take on Python version of examples and exercises in the book.
