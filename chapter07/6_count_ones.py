Algorithm: page 102
Time complexity: O(n)

- The outer loop is iterating over the inner arrays, 
- The inner loop is iterating over the actual numbers. 
The inner loop only runs for as many numbers as there are in total.
This algorithm simply processes each number, hence the functionâ€™s time complexity is O(N).
