Exercise 1 - Intersection of Two Arrays
Time complexity: O(n)

Write a function that returns the intersection of two arrays. The intersection is 
a third array that contains all values contained within the first two arrays. 
For example, the intersection of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] is [2, 4]. 
Your function should have a complexity of O(N). (If your programming language 
has a built-in way of doing this, donâ€™t use it. The idea is to build the algorithm yourself.)
